# Crypto Currency Analysis Using K-means Unsupervised Learning

## Overview

This project is applies K-means unsupervised machine learning modle to categorize various crypto currencies using data from cryptocurrency market data provider website [cryptocompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/). The data generated by this unsupervised learning model is then used to evaluate and identify, if possible, a class of  crypto currencies with the best investment potential. 

Two unsupervised learning models were created using Pandas get_dummies() text field encoding and using Scikit-Learn's LabelEncoding class.

### Analysis

#### Model Performance Comparison

The k-means unsupervised machine-learning module using Pandas’ get_dummies() label encoding performed very poorly when segregating related crypto currencies into classes. The (PCA) explained variance ratio for this encoding method shows that the total information contained in the three the principle component is only 6.98%. The k-means unsupervised machine-learning module using the Scikit-learn LabelEncoder encoding method performed strikingly better. The (PCA) explained variance ratio for this model encoding combination shows that the total information contained in the tree principle components is 92.70%. Thus, only the data from the classification model using the LabelEncoder encoding method is accurate enough to use in evaluating the investment potential of the crypto currencies in each of the classes generated by the unsupervised segregation process. This is confirmed when comparing the 3D scatter plot the LabelEncoding model verses the get_dummies() model. The 3D scatter plot for the LabelEncoder model show a much better grouping of crypto currencies and much more distinctive space separation between the classes the 3D plot for the  get_dummies()  model.  

#### Investment Potential Analysis

The classification data produced by the unsupervised k-mean clasification model using LabelEncoder encoding is not suffecient enought to draw definitive conclusions about the investment potention of the different cryptoclassification groups. The characteristics of the different crypt currency classes can be compared to the
