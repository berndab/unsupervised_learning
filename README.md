# Crypto Currency Analysis Using K-means Unsupervised Learning

## Overview

This project is utilizes unsupervised machine learning to segregate various crypto currencies into classes using cryptocurrency market data provided by the website [cryptocompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/). The crypto currencies classes generated by the model are evaluated to determine, if possible, the investment potential of the crypto currencies that are members of a particular class.

Two instances of the k-means unsupervised learning model are created and used to segregate crypto currencies into classes using two text field encoding algorithms. These two algorithms used for text field encoding are 
* Pandas' get_dummies() 
* Scikit-Learn's LabelEncoder

The performance of both model encoding combinations are compared and the classification output of the best performing model encoding combination is used in the evaluation of the investment potential of generated crypto currency classes.

### Analysis

#### Model Performance Comparison

The k-means unsupervised machine-learning model using Pandas’ dummies label encoding algorithm performs very poorly when segregating related crypto currencies into classes. The main reason for this is that the (PCA) explained variance ratio for this model encoding combination shows that the total information contained in the three the PCA principle components is only 6.98%. In contrast, k-means unsupervised machine-learning model with the Scikit-learn LabelEncoder algorithm performs strikingly better. The (PCA) explained variance ratio for this model encoding combination shows that the total information contained in the three PCA principle components is 92.70%. Thus, the data from the classification model using LabelEncoder encoding is the more accurate. This is further confirmed by comparing the 3D scatter plots of the classification data from each of the model encoding combinations.  The 3D scatter plot for the model LabelEncoder combination shows a much more distinct groupings of crypto currencies into classes than the 3D plot for the  model dummies comnination.  Based on the higher explained variance ratio and the more distinct class grouping of the model LabelEncoder combination, only classification data from this model instance is used when evaluating the investment potential of the crypto currencies in each of the classes generated. 

#### Investment Potential Analysis

The classification data produced by the model LabelEncoder combination is not sufficient enough to draw definitive conclusions about the investment potential of the different crypto classification classes generated by the model. However, some tentative conclusions can be drawn by comparing the features of the different crypto currency classes to characteristics of the crypto currencies that have the highest market capitalization as reported by the [cryptocompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/) crypto market data website. 

Eight of the top ten crypto currencies by market capitalization have a maximum limit for the number of crypto coins that can be mined. In addition, the current supply of these fixed maximum crypto currencies is currently about 75% of the maximum coins that can be mined. By looking at the 2D scatter plot for the LabelEncoder unsupervised segregation model, the crypto currencies in Class 4 seem to have the same features as the features of these current top 10. Most have a maximum limit on the number of crypto coins that can be mined and more have a crypto coin supply that is in the 75% range of the maximum crypto coins that can be mined for that crypto coin type.  Therefore, the crypto currencies of Class 4 appear to have the best investment potential. Further investigation is needed confirm this preliminary conclusion. 

#### Conclusion

The classification data generated from the unsupervised learning model shows potential in segregating crypto currencies into classes that can be used to evaluate the investment potential of the crypto currency contained in each generated class. The unsupervised model needs further refinement so that it generated classification data can be used to make more definitive determinations about the investment potential of the crypto currencies contained in each class.
