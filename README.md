# Crypto Currency Analysis Using K-means Unsupervised Learning

## Overview

This project is utilizes unsupervised machine learning to segregate various crypto currencies into classes using cryptocurrency market data provided by the website [cryptocompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/). The crypto currencies classes generated by the model are evaluated to determine, if possible, the investment potential of the crypto currencies that are members of a particular class.

Two instances of the k-means unsupervised learning model are created and used to segregate crypto currencies into classes using two text field encoding algorithms. These two algorithms used for text field encoding are 
* Pandas get_dummies() 
* Scikit-Learn's LabelEncoder

The performance of both model encoding combinations are compared and the classification output of the best performing model encoding combination is used in the evaluation of the investment potential of generated crypto currency classes.

### Analysis

#### Model Performance Comparison

The k-means unsupervised machine-learning module using Pandas’ get_dummies() label encoding performed very poorly when segregating related crypto currencies into classes. The (PCA) explained variance ratio for this encoding method shows that the total information contained in the three the principle component is only 6.98%. The k-means unsupervised machine-learning module using the Scikit-learn LabelEncoder encoding method performed strikingly better. The (PCA) explained variance ratio for this model encoding combination shows that the total information contained in the tree principle components is 92.70%. Thus, only the data from the classification model using the LabelEncoder encoding method is accurate enough to use in evaluating the investment potential of the crypto currencies in each of the classes generated by the unsupervised segregation process. This is confirmed when comparing the 3D scatter plot the LabelEncoding model verses the get_dummies() model. The 3D scatter plot for the LabelEncoder model show a much better grouping of crypto currencies and much more distinctive space separation between the classes the 3D plot for the  get_dummies()  model.  

#### Investment Potential Analysis

The classification data produced by the LabelEncoder model is not sufficient to draw definitive conclusions about the investment potential of the different crypto classification classes generated by the model. However some tentative conclusions can be drawn by comparing the features of the different crypto currency classes to characteristics of the crypto currencies that are generating the greatest return on investment as reported by the [cryptocompare](https://www.cryptocompare.com/) crypto market data website. 

Eight of the top ten crypto currencies by market capitalization have a maximum total for the number of crypto coins that can be mined, These maximum range from 21,000,000 to 100,000,000,000. In addition, the current supply of these fixed maximum crypto currencies is about 75% of the maximum coins that can be mined. By looking at the 2D scatter plot for the LabelEncoder unsupervised segregation model, the crypto currencies in Class 4 seem to have the same features as the features of the current top 10 currencies by market capitalization. Therefore the investment potential of the crypto currencies of Class 4 should be further investigated.

#### Conclusion

The classification data generated from the unsupervised learning model shows potential in segregating crypto currencies into classes and identifying the crypto currency class with the potential for the greatest return on investment. The model needs further refinement so that the data it generates can be used to definitively determine the crypto currency class or classes with the with the best investment potential.
